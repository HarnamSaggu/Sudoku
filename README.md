# Sudoku
A sudoku bactracker i did, this is the project i am most proud of as it took about 7 hrs and i didnt use the internets help when coding

it has a gui where you can setup a board, you use 1-9 to set a value, mouse and arrow keys to navigate
only allows 'legal' numbers (as in, you cant have 2 3s in the same column, row or square)
press enter to watch it solve
press space to reset

theres also just the 'solver'

it uses backtracking

idk how to comment code so sorry

have fun with it

(started this around march 2021)
